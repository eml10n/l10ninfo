title: Localization Community Knowledge Base
---

**L10N.INFO** is a community knowledge base by the contributors of [EngageMedia Digital Security Localization project](https://engagemedia.org/projects/localization/).

The project primarily aims to enhance the effectiveness of digital security initiatives in Southeast Asia by providing and promoting resources tailored to cultural and linguistic contexts. It focuses on five target languages: Burmese, Filipino, Indonesian, Khmer, and Thai. This site serves as a platform for experienced and novice localizers to exchange knowledge and share their work.

This site is built using [Hugo static site generator](https://gohugo.io/) and is maintained in a [respository on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/eml10n/l10ninfo). Once you have access, you may start contribute by creating new Markdown pages or edit existing ones using GitLab Web IDE and commit changes to the main branch of the repository.
