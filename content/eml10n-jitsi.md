[L10N.PARTY](https://l10n.party) is a self-hosted Jitsi instance maintained by the EngageMedia team for its localization community.

This Jitsi instance is hosted in Singapore and is available as a resource to EngageMedia contributors to organise virtual localization meetups, sprints, and other meetings.

The previous BigBlueButton meeting links (`bbb.l10n.info`) are now mapped to `l10n.party`.
