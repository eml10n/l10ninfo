The EngageMedia Localization team maintains a self-hosted Jitsi instance at [l10n.party](https://l10n.party).

This Jitsi instance is hosted in Singapore and is available as a resource to EngageMedia contributons to organise virtual localization meetups, sprints, and other meetings.

The previous BigBlueButton meeting links (`bbb.l10n.info`) are now mapped to `l10n.party`.
