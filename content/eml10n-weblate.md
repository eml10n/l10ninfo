The EngageMedia Localization team maintains a self-hosted Weblate instance at [l10n.space](https://l10n.space).

This Weblate instance is hosted in Singapore and is available as a resource to EngageMedia contributors to localize digital security tools and guides that are not hosted anywhere else.

Registration on this Weblate instance is open to anyone with a GitLab, GitHub, or BitBucket account. To create a new translation project on this Weblate instance, contact the administrators at [l10n.space/contact](https://l10n.space/contact/).
