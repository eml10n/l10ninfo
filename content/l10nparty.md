[L10N.PARTY](https://jitsi.l10n.party) is a self-hosted [Jitsi Meet](https://jitsi.org/) instance maintained by the EngageMedia Open Technology team for its localization community.

This Jitsi Meet instance is hosted in Singapore and is available as a resource to EngageMedia contributors to organise virtual localization meetups, sprints, and other meetings.

The previous BigBlueButton meeting links (`bbb.l10n.info`) will automatically redirect to `jitsi.l10n.party`.
